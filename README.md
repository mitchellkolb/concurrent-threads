I explored the pthread.h library in C to solve math problems with multi-threading. I showcase the effective use of threads, mutexes, and barriers to handle complex mathematical computations and ensure race condition-free operations.

# What I Learned in this Project
- Main ideas around Parallel Computing and Concurrent Programming. (Parallelism vs Concurrency)
- Principles of threads and their advantages/disadvantages over processes.
- Threads synchronization tools like mutex locks, join, condition variables and barriers. 
- Thread management terms like race condition, critical region, and deadlocks.
- Semaphores and their advantages over condition variables.

# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on my local machine inside of a virtual machine using:
- Ubuntu Version 20.04.03 found at this [link](http://lt.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.3/).
> [!NOTE]
> I had to use this version of Ubuntu but it is not required to run this codebase. 
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../multi-threading-in-C/Barriers/` or `~.../multi-threading-in-C/Mutexes/`
- Run my `mk` file to compile the codebase and run the a.out executable.
